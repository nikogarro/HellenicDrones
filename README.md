# HellenicDrones
Drones Vision Augmentation

## Installation
Use [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) üêç a free minimal installer for conda 
(The place in which we will create the environment in which the programs will run).

Download the installer [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#windows-installers) 
for Windows.

![ŒµŒπŒ∫œåŒΩŒ±](https://github.com/nikogarro/HellenicDrones/assets/117863158/bc52aff6-d689-4562-a3d2-012a638c3531)


We will download Python version 3.10 which comes with Conda 23.3.1 Python 3.10.10 
released on April 24, 2023.

After the installation is completed we will search and open Anaconda Prompt which is an "enhanced"
windows cmd which automatically includes the conda installation of Python to your PATH environment variable meaning
there is no need to set the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

After everything is installed you should see something like this.

üí° If you run into any issues or need more guidance visit [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html#installation).

‚ö° To speed up the process of installing new depedencies we will use Libmamba a faster conda solver
which can yield +50-80% resolving speeds.
Do this by putting the following commands on Anaconda Prompt.
```bash
conda update -n base conda
```
and
```bash
conda install -n base conda-libmamba-solver
conda config --set solver libmamba
```

### Setting up the environment

We need to install the necesary dependencys which are requirent, to do this we should be **creating** 
a new environment by using the following command
```bash
conda create --name yolov8 python=3.10
```
We named the new env yolov8 and used python version 3.10.
Afterwards we need to **activate** the new env by
```bash
activate yolov8
```
The (base) on the parathesis should now be changed to your new env name for me yolov8.
![ŒµŒπŒ∫œåŒΩŒ±](https://github.com/nikogarro/HellenicDrones/assets/117863158/065d5eb1-0217-41de-a3a5-2eeb4d4796fb)

We can skip all of the above if we are gonna just use this project and follow the bellow steps on the
(base) env.

üì¢ It is not recomended as package issues might occures if future changes or prototyping happens.

üí° Here is a fast getting started [tutorial](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html)
and a helpful conda [cheatsheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf).

## Installation of the Project

Now let's start with the fun part start by typing on the activated conda environment in me case (yolov8).
```bash
pip install ultralytics
```
This gonna a take a while as it is downloading all the necessary packages and their depedencies 
to train, evaluate, predict and export a yolov8 model.

üì¢ This downloads the cpu version of Pytorch if you have a gpu to run the model on you need to go to
[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

and install it with the apropriate cuda version by coping the command.

![ŒµŒπŒ∫œåŒΩŒ±](https://github.com/nikogarro/HellenicDrones/assets/117863158/ce23efe9-93e8-42eb-badd-ddbc36d351f8)

and running it on Anaconda Prompt by putting a ``--upgrade`` in front of torch like this.

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```

To check if everything has gone smoothly type ``python`` followed by an ``import torch`` followed by a ``torch.__version__``  and ``torch.cuda_is_available()`` ( if you have a gpu) finally to exit type ``exit()``.

## Downloading the pretrained model.
Go to https://github.com/nikogarro/HellenicDrones and click on best.pt (this is the default pytorch model) and then download it.
